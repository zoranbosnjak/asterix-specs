        remark
            Notes:

                1. For Mode S aircraft, the SPI information is also contained in I007/230.
                2. To bits 3/2 of extension 1 (FOE/FRI): IFF interrogators supporting a three level
                   classification of the processing of the Mode 4 interrogation result
                   shall encode the detailed response information in data item M4E of
                   the Reserved Expansion Field of category 007. In this case the value
                   for FOE/FRI in I007/020 shall be set to “00”.
                   However, even those interrogators shall use I007/020 to encode the information “No reply”.
                3. To bit 6 of extension 1 (XPP): This bit shall always be set when the X-pulse has
                   been extracted, independent from the Mode it was extracted with.
                4. To bit 7 of extension 1 (ERR): This bit set to “1” indicates that the range of the
                   target is beyond the maximum range in data item I007/040. In this
                   case – and this case only - the ERR Data Item in the Reserved
                   Expansion Field shall provide the range value of the Measured
                   Position in Polar Coordinates.
                5. To Extension 2: The EUROCONTROL Specification for European Mode S Stations Edition 4.0
                   (EMS 4.0) [Ref. 4] defines new functionalities that can use external data inputs.
                   The possibilities described in EMS 4.0 cover the presence of target information acquired
                   via the on-site ADS-B, the Surveillance Cluster Network or the Passive Acquisition Interface.
                   The second extension provides information – per target – on whether such information is available
                   supporting performance improvements, e.g. Passive Acquisition, and new features, e.g. detection
                   of a potential IC Conflict.
                6. To Extensions 3, 4, and 5: The transponder MOPS ED-73F/DO-181F (Minimum Operational Performance Standard
                   [Ref. 2]) defines new optional functionalities:

                       - Basic Dataflash (to reduce BDS registers extractions by groundsystems)
                       - IRM (Interrogation/Reply Monitoring)
                       - Phase Overlay (to convey more data within a single long Roll Call Reply, using Downlink Formats 20 and 21)

                7. To Extensions 3 and 4: To populate bits in these extensions, Mode S radars will have to decode/analyse
                   the content of BDS register 1,0 (bits 15, 42 and 44) as per [Ref. 2].

        remark
            Notes:

                1. It has to be stressed that a series of one or more W/E conditions can
                   be reported per target report.
                2. Data conveyed in this item are of secondary importance, and
                   can generally also be derived from the processing of mandatory items.
                3. Definitions can be found in SUR.ET1.ST03.1000-STD-01-01 Radar Sensor
                   Performance Analysis.
                4. Warning/Error codes of 64 and higher are reserved for Directed
                   Interrogation messages.
                5. Values 25 to 30 and 32 to 36 have been defined to comply with the Edition
                   4.0 of the EUROCONTROL Specification for European Mode S Station (EMS) [Ref. 7]
                   and to provide the possibility to report the following information:

                       - Code 25: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
                         acquire the surveillance information has been reached;
                       - Code 26: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
                         extract BDS Registers has been reached;
                       - Code 27: inconsistency detected between the contents of the
                         message and the BDS register overlayed;
                       - Code 28: a BDS swap has been detected and the respective information
                         has been discarded;
                       - Code 29: the track has been updated while being in the zenithal
                         gap (also referred to as “Cone of Silence”);
                       - Code 30: the radar had lost track of an aircraft and subsequently
                         re-acquired it.
                       - Code 31: ???
                       - Code 32: the transponder has used a wrong Downlink Format.
                       - Code 33 & 34: reporting specific Transponder Anomalies.
                       - Code 35 indicates that a plot has been obtained despite a high probability
                         of an IC Conflict with another interrogator.
                       - Code 36 indicates that a plot is in a configuration that it would be possible
                         to detect an IC Conflict with another interrogator. Currently no potential IC
                         Conflict has been detected.
                         NOTE: Although implementation dependent, the use of this code should
                         be limited to the target acquisition phase.

                6. Together with Codes 35 and 36 the possibility to communicate the area within which
                   the detection of an IC Conflict is possible was implemented in the Category 034
                   Specification [Ref. 8] by means of Message Type 008.
                7. The use of this Data Item is implementation specific and shall be described in the ICD
                   of the system generating the Category 048 target reports.

            Notes:

                1. In case of no detection, the extrapolated position expressed in slant
                   polar co-ordinates may be sent, except for a track cancellation message.
                   No detection is signalled by the TYP field set to zero in I007/020
                   Target Report Descriptor.
                2. This item represents the measured target position of the plot, even
                   if associated with a track, for the present antenna scan. It is
                   expressed in polar co-ordinates in the local reference system,
                   centred on the radar station.
                3. In case of combined detection by a PSR and an SSR, then the SSR
                   position is sent.
                4. For targets having a range beyond 256 NM the data item
                   “Extended Range Report” has been added to the Reserved Expansion
                   Field of category 007. The presence of this data item is indicated
                   by the ERR bit set to one in data item I007/020, first extension.
                   The ERR data item shall only be sent if the value of RHO is equal
                   to or greater than 256NM.
                   Please note that if this data item is used, the Encoding Rule to
                   data item I007/040 still applies, meaning that the extra item in
                   the Reserved Expansion Field shall be transmitted in addition to
                   data item I007/040.
                   If the Extended Range Report item in the Reserved Expansion Field
                   is used, it is recommended to set the value of RHO in data item
                   I007/040 to its maximum, meaning bits 32/17 all set to 1.

            Notes:

                1. Bit 15 has no meaning in the case of a smoothed Mode-3/A code and
                   is set to 0 for a calculated track. For Mode S, it is set to one
                   when an error correction has been attempted.
                2. For Mode S, bit 16 is normally set to zero, but can exceptionally
                   be set to one to indicate a non-validated Mode-3/A code (e.g. alert
                   condition detected, but new Mode-3/A code not successfully extracted).
                3. For radar systems interrogation with various technologies (such as
                   military radars interrogating in Mode S and Mode 5), element I007/REF/GEN07/ALTM3
                   provides the possibility to transmit an alternative Mode-3/A value. If this Data
                   Item carries a Mode-3/A value that has been derived from a Mode 5 Reply/Report,
                   then bit-3 in I007/REF/MD5/SF#1 or bit-3 in I048/REF/M5N/SF#1 shall be set to 1.

            Notes:

                1. When Mode C code / Mode S altitude code is present but not decodable,
                   the “Undecodable Mode C code / Mode S altitude code” Warning/Error
                   should be sent in I007/030.
                2. When local tracking is applied and the received Mode C code / Mode S
                   altitude code corresponds to an abnormal value (the variation with
                   the previous plot is estimated too important by the tracker),
                   the “Mode C code / Mode S altitude code abnormal value compared
                   to the track“ Warning/Error should be sent in I007/030.
                3. The value shall be within the range described by ICAO Annex 10
                4. For Mode S, bit 15 (G) is set to one when an error correction has
                   been attempted.
                5. For radar systems interrogating with various technologies (such as military
                   radars interrogating in Mode S and Mode 5), element I007/REF/GEN07/ALTFL
                   provides the possibility to transmit an alternative Flight Level value.
                   If this Data Item carries a Flight Level value that has been derived
                   from a Mode 5 Reply/Report, then bit-2 in I007/REF/MD5/SF#1 and in bit-2

        remark
            Notes:

                1. The Request Number is created by the client, which directs the sensor to
                   perform an interrogation.
                2. The sensor will use the same request number for all subsequent messages
                   related to the respective directed interrogation.
                3. The sensor will not accept a request numbere which is currently processed.
                4. In some cases (e.g. overlapping of directed interrogation windows with
                   partially equal mode combinations) the sensor cannot determine which
                   request number to assign to target reports due to ambiguity. In this case one
                   matching request number will be used and the sensor has to generate an
                   "ambiguous acknowledge" message when accepting the command.
                5. A value of 0 for the Request Number will cause an Interrogation reject by the
                   sensor. Therefore, the Request Number shall always be greater than or equal
                   to 1.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Using the Acknowledge the sensor will confirm the receipt of the directed
                   interrogation command.
                2. After the sensor has completed the interrogation, i.e. the interrogations are
                   transmitted, the sensor will report an Interrogation Finished message.
                3. When no further targets for a directed interrogation are expected, an
                   Interrogation Completed message will be issued by the interrogator.
                4. Although each Directed Interrogation should result in exactly one target report,
                   cases may occur resulting in error conditions. These potential error conditions
                   are signalled with item I007/030.

            Notes:

                1. When present, this window defines the area which should be interrogated and
                   for which the target reports are expected.
                2. The sensor shall use this window to determine the azimuth range for the
                   directed interrogation.
                3. The sensor may use this window to tag the extracted targets within this window
                   with the request number.
                4. In case multiple request windows overlap, the sensor may respond with an
                   Ambiguous Acknowledge. It shall be noted, that internally generated
                   expectation windows for directed interrogations related to targets/tracks may
                   also lead to Ambiguous Acknowledge Responses.
                5. The target window is meant within a NE related coordinated system with the
                   point of origin at the radar head.
