                   Web Site (http://www.eurocontrol.int/services/system-area-code-list).
                2. In case of message originating from an FPPS, the Server Identification
                   Tag corresponds to the SDPS unit receiving the Miniplan.

            Notes:

                1. The User numbers are predefined in the User registration data base
                   of the SDPS Unit to which the User wants to connect.
                2. In case of message originating from an FPPS, the User Number
                   corresponds to the FPPS one.

    020 "Time of ASTERIX Report Generation"
        definition
            Time of the generation of the ASTERIX category 032 report in the form of
            elapsed time since last midnight, expressed as UTC.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. The Time of ASTERIX Report Generation is reset to zero at every midnight.
                2. This time is determined at an application level (e.g. time at which
                   a message is filled), and not at the communication level (i.e. not
                   the time at which the data-block is sent).

    035 "Type of Message"
        definition
            This data item allows for a more convenient handling of the message at the
            receiver side by further defining the type of transaction.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Each Track Number (i.e. either a Master or a Slave Track Number)
                   is composed of a System Unit Identification (i.e. the identification
                   of the SDPS unit processing the) together with the relevant System
                   Track Number (i.e. the number of the track local to the SDPS Unit
                   in question).
                2. The Composed Track Number is used by co-operating SDPS units to
                   uniquely identify a track. It consists of the unit identifier and
                   system track number for each unit involved in the co-operation.
                   The first unit identification identifies the unit that is responsible
                   for the track amalgamation.
                3. The Master Track Number and the possible extensions (Slave Tracks
                   Numbers) are identically composed.

        remark
            Note:
                - Each one of the seven octets contains an ASCII Character. The Callsign
                  is always left adjusted. It contains up to seven upper-case alphanumeric

            Notes:

                1. NU1, NU2 and LTR each contain an ASCII character (upper case alphabetic).
                2. For details refer to ICAO Annex 14 Chapter 5 [Ref. 4].
                3. Estimated times are derived from flight plan processing systems.
                   Predicted times are derived by the fusion system based on surveillance
                   data. For definitions see [Ref.4]
                4. Each one of the six Octets contains an ASCII Character. The Aircraft
                   Stand identification is always left adjusted. It contains up to six
                   upper-case alphanumeric characters, the remaining character positions
                   (if any) are padded with space characters.
                5. Each one of the seven Octets contains an ASCII Character. The SID is
                   always left adjusted. It contains up to seven alphanumeric characters,
                   the remaining character positions (if any) are padded with space characters.
                6. Each one of the seven Octets contains an ASCII Character. The STAR
                   is always left adjusted. It contains up to seven alphanumeric
                   characters, the remaining character positions (if any) are padded
                   with space characters.
