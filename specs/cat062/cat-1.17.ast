            spare 4
        remark
            Notes:

                1. Track type and coasting can also be derived from I062/290 System Track Update Ages
                2. If the system supports the technology, default value (0) means that the technology was used to produce the report
                3. If the system does not support the technology, default value is meaningless.
                4. Bits (EMS): other than subfield #11 of data item I062/380, these
                   bits allow the SDPS to set the emergency indication as derived from
                   other sources than ADS-B (e.g. based on the Mode 3/A code).
                5. Bit (PFT): with this flag an SDPS can indicate that internal
                   processing points to the track being potentially false. Details on the
                   internal processing are system dependent.
                6. Bit (FPLT): this bit - if set - indicates that the information contained
                   in the target report has been updated by flight plan related data
                   because no surveillance data was available for the target, or was
                   created based on flight plan related data in areas with no
                   surveillance.
                7. Bit (DUPT) is set to 1 if the correlation between the target report and a flight
                   plan is not possible because the Mode 3/A code stated in the flight plan exists
                   more than once in the surveillance data.
                8. Bit (DUPF) - if set to 1 - indicates that for a specific surveillance target more
                   than one flight plan exists which makes correlation impossible.
                9. Bit (DUPM) is set to 1 if a target was correlated manually but also a regular
                   flight plan exists.
                10. All tracks for which bits DUPT, DUPF or DUPM are set to 1 are marked on the CWP.

            Notes:

                1. The flags M2, M3, MC refer to the contents of data subitems I062/120,
                   I062/060 and I062/135 respectively. The flag M1 refers to the contents
                   of the Subfield #5 (Extended Mode 1 Code in Octal Representation).
                2. If an authenticated Mode 5 reply is received with the Emergency
                   bit set, then the Military Emergency bit (ME) in Data Item I062/080,
                   Track Status, shall be set.
                3. If an authenticated Mode 5 reply is received with the Identification
                   of Position bit set, then the Special Position Identification
                   bit (SPI) in Data Item I062/080, Track Status, shall be set.
                4. The resolution implied by the LSB is better than the resolution
                   with which Mode 5 position reports are transmitted from aircraft
                   transponders using currently defined formats.
                5. GA is coded as a 14-bit two's complement binary number with
                   an LSB of 25 ft. irrespective of the setting of RES.
                6. The minimum value of GA that can be reported is -1000 ft.
                7. If Subfield #1 is present, the M1 bit in Subfield #1 indicates
                   whether the Extended Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 5 reply or
                   a Mode 1 reply. If Subfield #1 is not present, the Extended
                   Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 1 reply.
                8. TOS shall be assumed to be zero if Subfield #6 is not present.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Except for Track Age, the ages are counted from Data Item I062/070,
                   Time Of Track Information, using the following formula:
                   Age = Time of track information - Time of last detection used
                   to update the track
                2. The time of last detection is derived from monosensor category time of day
                3. If the data has never been received, then the corresponding
                   subfield is not sent.
                4. Maximum value means maximum value or above.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Despite there are now two subfields (#29 and #30) reporting the ages
                   of, respectively, the Indicated Airspeed track data and the Mach
                   Number track data, the subfield #8 (and so its presence bit , bit-32) is
                   kept free in order to prevent a full incompatibility with previous
                   releases of ASTERIX Cat. 062 already implemented.
                2. In all the subfields, the age is the time delay since the value was
                   measured

            Notes:

                1. NC is set to one when the aircraft will not fly the path described
                   by the TCP data.
                2. TCP numbers start from zero.
                3. LT = Lateral Type
                4. VT = Vertical Type
                5. TOV gives the estimated time before reaching the point. It is
                   defined as the absolute time from midnight.
                6. TOV is meaningful only if TOA is set to 0
                7. Refer to ICAO Draft SARPs for ACAS for detailed explanations.
                8. A positive value represents a right turn, whereas a negative value
                   represents a left turn.
                9. Value 15 means 15 degrees/s or above.
                10. Velocity uncertainty category of the least accurate velocity component
                11. Positive longitude indicates East. Positive latitude indicates North.
                12. LSB is required to be thinner than 10 ft by ICAO
                13. Only DAPs that can not be encoded into other subfields of this item
                    should be sent using subfield #25
                14. BPS is the barometric pressure setting of the aircraft minus 800 mb.

            Notes:

                - The composed track number is used by co-operating units to uniquely
                  identify a track. It consists of the unit identifier and system
                  track number for each unit involved in the co-operation. The first
                  unit identification identifies the unit that is responsible for the
                  track amalgamation.
