        remark
            Notes:

                - The information of the Lateral Navigation Mode LNAV complements
                  the already existing Navigation Modes in Data Item I062/380/SF#7.

                - I062/REF/STS/DAD indicates a service wide duplicate address status
                  detected by the SDPS. This means that the SDPS provides CAT062
                  reports with different track ID with the same 24-bit address for
                  the type of address as defined in I062/REF/STS/ATP.

                - I062/REF/STS/DUP indicates the duplicate address condition as
                  provided by a sensor. The meaning of DUP#VAL is implementation
                  dependent and needs to be described in the sensor ICD.

                - I062/REF/STS/CSX indicates if the track is in the extended coasting
                  phase or not. Extended Coasting is a coast phase with special
                  properties following the normal coast phase. During the extended
                  coasting I062/080/CST shall be set to one. Extended Coasting is
                  implementation dependent and shall be described in the ICD.

                    Notes:

                        - The ADS-B Version Number is contained in Data Item I062/380/SF#11/VN.

                        - Since in this edition of the REF I062/REF/PS3 is the only Element
                          in this Item, the Element Populated Bit strictly would not be be
                          necessary. However, if in a future edition use is made of the Spare
                          Bits, the Element Populated Bit becomes important.

                        - For ADS-B Version 3 systems as defined in ED-102B/DO-260C (Ref. [5],
                          as defined in the core Specification of Category 062), the values
                          have been re-defined. I062/REF/PS3 is to be used exclusively for
                          Version 3 ADS-B systems as defined in I062/380/SF#11/VN. For ADS-B
                          systems with a version number below 3, the PS shall be encoded in
                          Data Item I062/380/SF#11/STAT. However, since values have been
                          re-defined in ADS-B Version 3, mapping is required to ensure that
                          information is not lost in systems not yet capable to decode this
                          Edition of Category 062. This mapping shall be done according to
                          the following table: ::

            Notes:

                - TABS is the “Traffic Awareness Beacon System” as defined by
                  ETSO-C199 / TSO-C199.

                - PW contains the nearest minimum transmit power (in Watts) at
                  the antenna port. The nearest minimum setting in this field
                  would be rounded down from the actual design value. For example,
                  if the avionics is designed to transmit at 100W out of the antenna
                  port, the encoded value in this field would be for 70W (decimal 1).

                - Bit-12 shall be set to 1 when the aircraft transmits the maximum
                  encodable value (i.e. 31 representing a TAO greater than 58m).
                  In this case TAO#VAL shall be set to the maximum encodable TAO
                  (i.e. 58m).

                - The TAO is measured along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft
                  from the forward end.

                    Notes:

                        - The items I062/REF/CST and I062/REF/CSN are not suited for
                          track-to-track fusion since a track can be supported by radar and
                          MLAT and ADS-B. The supporting technology of these items allow
                          only a statement whether an input is supported by radar or MLAT or
                          ADS-B.

                        - This item is a generalized version of I062/REF/CST and I062/REF/CSN.

                        - I062/REF/MOI/INPS/SSS indicates whether the contributing source
                          to a track is a sensor measurement or tracked data.

                        - I062/REF/MOI/INPS/INCS, Independent non-cooperative surveillance,
                          is the generalization of primary surveillance radar (PSR) e.g. multi
                          static primary surveillance radar (MSPSR).

                        - I062/REF/MOI/INPS/MDS includes Mode 5 interrogation.

                        - I062/REF/MOI/INPS/ADS subsumes all types of ADS-B link technologies
                          including Mode 5 Level 2 Squitter.

                        - The values of the address type ATP (as part of I062/REF/MOI/INPS/IDN
                          for TIDN = 2) are technology dependent. How to populate them shall be
                          described in the ICD of the system generating the input reports to
                          the SDPS.

                        - The address extension number AEN (as part of I062/REF/MOI/INPS/IDN
                          for TIDN = 2) is a unique supplement to the 24-bit address of the same
                          address type, which stays unchanged over the lifetime of a track.

                          Calculated Track Velocity (Cartesian), of 0.25 m/s is not sufficient
                          for all applications addressing the ground segment especially for
                          slow moving targets.

                          and DVY have to be added to the corresponding velocity values of
                          I062/185.

                        - The determination of the system calculated separation minimum is
                          system dependent and shall be described in the ICD e.g.

                    Notes:

                        - The Inverse Point Scale Factor is the quotient of the length of the
                          unprojected vector and the length of a projected vector. The
                          antipodal point is given by an inverse Point Scale factor of 0.

                        - The Meridian Convergence is the angle with respect to geographic
                          North of a projected vector minus the angle with respect to
                          geographic North of the unprojected vector mapped to the range
                          [-180, 180].

                        - Point scale factor and meridian convergence is applied to compute
                          the track velocity vector relative to system reference point
                          (I062/REF/TVS) from the local Cartesian velocity vector(I062/185).

                        - They can also be used to convert the local Cartesian acceleration
                          (I062/210) to the projected acceleration on the system plane.

                        - A single motion model is not optimal to describe the behaviour of an
                          aircraft, which moves usually for extended duration in a straight line
                          followed by turn manoeuvres. The Interacting Multiple Model (IMM)
                          estimator provides a framework to handle the interaction of different
                          models in a calculation efficient manner.

                          IMM implementation remains system specific and the meaning of a
                          specific model ID may be different.

                        - The main use case for this item is to support the performance
                          evaluation of the SDPS and/or the tuning of the IMM.

                          message is lost e.g. due to a UDP connection, each surveillance
                          data consumer needs a timeout mechanism to address tracks for
                          which no termination message is received. The provision of the time
                          of track termination supports a proper setting of the applicable
                          timeout.

                        - Usually, a plot updating a track either has no impact or prolongs the
                          time of track termination. In case of ADS-B when for a static target
                          beginning to move the position squitter period changes from 5s to
                          0.5s, the time of track termination may be reduced. The time of track
                          termination provides a means for analysis on the proper handling of
                          such circumstances.

                        - The time of track termination can be used for synchronization of the
                          track store of a slave tracker with the master tracker, where only the
                          master tracker is allowed to schedule the time of track termination
                          within the slave. Thus, the time of track termination ensures that the
                          slave tracker terminates all tracks, which are no longer supported
                          by the master tracker.
