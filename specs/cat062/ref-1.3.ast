                    Notes:

                        1. The ADS-B Version Number is contained in Data Item I062/380/SF#11/VN.
                        2. Since in this edition of the REF I062/REF/PS3 is the only Element
                           in this Item, the Element Populated Bit strictly would not be necessary.
                           However, if in a future edition use is made of the Spare Bits, the Element
                           Populated Bit becomes important.
                        3. For ADS-B Version 3 systems as defined in ED-102B/DO-260C (Ref. [5],
                           as defined in the core Specification of Category 062), the values have been
                           re-defined. I062/REF/PS3 is to be used exclusively for Version 3 ADS-B systems
                           as defined in I062/380/SF#11/VN. For ADS-B systems with a version number below 3,
                           the PS shall be encoded in Data Item I062/380/SF#11/STAT.
                           However, since values have been re-defined in ADS-B Version 3, mapping is required
                           to ensure that information is not lost in systems not yet capable to decode this
                           Edition of Category 062. This mapping shall be done according to the following table: ::

                             ADS-B Version 3 (PS3)           ADS-Version < 3 (I062/380 - STAT)

            Notes:

                1. TABS is the “Traffic Awareness Beacon System” as defined by ETSO-C199 / TSO-C199.
                2. PW contains the nearest minimum transmit power (in Watts) at the antenna port.
                   The nearest minimum setting in this field would be rounded down from the actual
                   design value. For example, if the avionics is designed to transmit at 100W out of
                   the antenna port, the encoded value in this field would be for 70W (decimal 1).
                3. Bit-12 shall be set to 1 when the aircraft transmits the maximum encodable value
                   (i.e. 31 representing a TAO greater than 58m). In this case TAO#VAL shall be set
                   to the maximum encodable TAO (i.e. 58m).
                4. The TAO is measured along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft from the forward end.
