                1. LSB is calculated as :math:`2^{-6+f}`.
                2. A default quantisation unit of 1/64 NM is obtained for a value of f = 0.
                3. Negative values are expressed in 2's complement form, bit-32 and
                   bit-16 shall be set to 0 for positive values and 1 for negative values.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Smoothed Mode-2 data (bit-14 set to one) is used when the plot
                   contains no Mode-2 code or the Mode-2 codes of the plot and track
                   are different.
                2. Bits-16/15 have no meaning in the case of a smoothed Mode-2 and
                   are set to 0 for a calculated track.

            Notes:

                1. The detector signals a garbled code (bit-15 set to one) when at
                   least two replies are overlapping.
                2. Smoothed Mode-3/A data (bit-14 set to a one) are used in the case
                   of the absence of Mode-3/A code information in the plot, or in the
                   case of a difference between the plot and track Mode-3/A code information.
                3. Bits-16/15 have no meaning in the case of a smoothed Mode-3/A and
                   are set to 0 for a calculated track.

            Notes:

                1. The exchange of this Data Item allows the easy derivation of the
                   correct UTC time value, provided that the clocks at the data source
                   and sink(s) are less than 512 seconds out of synchronisation.
                   Special care has to be taken at the transition of an "all ones"
                   value to an "all zeros" value (every 512 seconds).
                2. The time of day value is reset to 0 each day at midnight.
