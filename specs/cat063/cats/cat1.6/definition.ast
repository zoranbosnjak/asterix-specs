        remark
            1. GO/NOGO information from PSR, SSR, Mode S, ADS and MLT is derived
               from monosensor categories and has a meaning only for operational
               sensors, whereas (CON) is derived by the SDPS.
            2. The information (OPS), (ODP), (OXT), (MSC) and (TSV) are only related to
               CNS/ATM Ground Station and are derived from monosensor category
               (ASTERIX Cat 023).
