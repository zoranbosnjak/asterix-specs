    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the
            messages at the receiver side by further defining the type of
            information.

        remark
            NOTES:
              1. In applications where data of various types is exchanged, the Message
                 Type Data Item facilitates the proper message handling at the receiver
                 side.
              2. All Message Type values are reserved for common standard use.
