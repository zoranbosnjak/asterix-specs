    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the messages at
            the receiver side by further defining the type of transaction.

            table
                1: Video Summary message
                2: Video message
        remark
            Notes:

                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged,
                   the Message Type Data Item facilitates the proper report handling
                   at the receiver side.
                2. All Message Type values are reserved for common standard use.
                3. The list of items present for the two message types is defined in
                   the following table.

                Table: Message Types ::
