    300 "Pair Identification"
        definition
            The use of a pair identifier in this data item, that is common
            with its counterpart in ASTERIX Category I015/400, enables direct
            mapping from the INCS Target Report to the Transmitter/Receiver
            Pair that contributed to the target report.
            This is an identifier pointing to a measurement that was created
            from a specific contributing pair where the Pair Identifier refers
            to the index that details both the transmitter characteristics
            (DVB-T, DAB, FM, dedicated etc) and the receiver characteristics.

        remark
            NOTE - Regarding Transmitter Identification:
                a. Individual channels of a transmitter are considered as
                separate collocated transmitters.

                b. A Transmitter ID may be assigned to individual channels
                of a compound transmitter. i.e. a single multi-channel
                transmitter may be assigned several Tx ID.

                c. The Tx ID shall be used in a unique way for a specific
                SAC/SIC.

            NOTE - Regarding Transmitter Latitude and Longitude and Altitude:
                a. The Tx Location and Altitude is the position of the
                component in WGS-84 coordinates. The vertical distance between
                the component and the projection of its position on the earth’s
                ellipsoid, as defined by WGS-84, in two’s complement form.

            NOTE - Regarding Transmission Time Offset
                a. Time offset of transmitter compared to the reference
                transmitter within the single frequency network (SFN).

            NOTE - Regarding Accuracy of Transmission Time Offset
                a. The Accuracy of the Transmission Time Offset is the Standard
                Deviation of the measurement of the transmission time offset
                between the transmitter channel compared to the reference
                transmitter within the single frequency network (SFN).

            NOTE - Regarding Parallel Transmitter Index
                a. The Parallel Transmitter Index is the identification of the
                transmitter via index, which is sent in parallel.

                b. For referring to a one-octet index bits-16/9 shall be set
                to zero.

                c. This index shall be used in a unique way for a specific
                SAC/SIC.

                d. In a Single Frequency Network the parallel transmitter
                index is the index of the reference transmitter.
