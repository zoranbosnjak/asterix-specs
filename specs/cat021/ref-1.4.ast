        remark
            Notes:

                - BPS is the barometric pressure setting of the aircraft minus 800 hPa

                - A value of "0" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 800 hPa or
                  less has been selected.

                - A value of "409.5" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 1209.5
                  hPa or more has been selected.

        remark
            On many aircraft, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem receives
            Selected Heading from a Mode Control Panel / Flight Control Unit
            (MCP / FCU). Users of this data are cautioned that the Selected
            Heading value transmitted by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem
            does not necessarily reflect the true intention of the airplane during
            certain flight modes (e.g., during LNAV mode).
