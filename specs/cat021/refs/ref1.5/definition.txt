        remark
            Notes:

                - BPS is the barometric pressure setting of the aircraft minus 800 hPa

                - A value of "0" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 800 hPa or
                  less has been selected.

                - A value of "409.5" indicates that in the aircraft a value of 1209.5
                  hPa or more has been selected.

        remark
            On many aircraft, the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem receives
            Selected Heading from a Mode Control Panel / Flight Control Unit
            (MCP / FCU). Users of this data are cautioned that the Selected
            Heading value transmitted by the ADS-B Transmitting Subsystem
            does not necessarily reflect the true intention of the airplane during
            certain flight modes (e.g., during LNAV mode).

                           However, since values have been re-defined in ADS-B Version 3,

                           antenna port. The nearest minimum setting in this field would be
                           rounded down from the actual design value. For example, if the
                           avionics is designed to transmit at 100W out of the antenna port, the
                           encoded value in this field would be for 70W (decimal 1).

                          Code Bits were equal to 0.

                        - The valid bit is set if the Code was only reported once for that target.

                remark
                    Within Mode 5 reports, the X-Pulse can be set for the following cases:

                    1. In a combined Mode 1 and Mode 2 report: in this case the X5 bit and the X2 bit
                    shall be set;

                    2. In a combined Mode 3 and Mode C report: in this case the X5 bit and the X3
                    bit shall be set;

                    3. In a Mode 5 PIN data report: in this case the X5 bit and the XP bit shall be set.
                    The X1 bit and the XC bit are meaningless as in Mode 1 and Mode C
                    replies/reports the X Pulse is not defined. They are kept for compatibility
                    reasons.
