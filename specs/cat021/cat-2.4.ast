        remark
            Notes:

                1. Bit 3 indicates that the position reported by the target is
                   within a credible range from the ground station. The range
                   check is followed by the CPR validation to ensure that global
                   and local position decoding both indicate valid position
                   information. Bit 3=1 indicates that the range check was done,
                   but the CPR validation is not yet completed.
                   Once CPR validation is completed, Bit 3 will be reset to 0.
                2. The second extension signals the reasons for which the report has
                   been indicated as suspect (indication Confidence Level (CL) in the
                   first extension).
                3. Bit 2 indicates that the Range Check failed, i.e. the target is
                   reported outside the credible range for the Ground Station. For
                   operational users such a target will be suppressed. In services
                   used for monitoring the Ground Station, the target will be
                   transmitted with bit 2 indicating the fault condition.
                4. Bit 6, if set to 1, indicates that the position reported by the
                   target was validated by an independent means and a discrepancy
                   was detected. If no independent position check is implemented,
                   the default value “0” is to be used.
                5. Bit 5 represents the setting of the GO/NOGO-bit as defined in
                   item I023/100 of category 023 [Ref. 3].
                6. Bit 7, if set to 1, indicates that a lookup in a Black-list/White-list
                   failed, indicating that the target may be suspect

                - Bit 7 (VNS) when set to 1 indicates that the aircraft transmits a
                  MOPS Version indication that is not supported by the Ground Station.
                  However, since MOPS versions are supposed to be backwards compatible,
                  the GS has attempted to interpret the message and achieved a credible
                  result. The fact that the MOPS version received is not supported by
                  the GS is submitted as additional information to subsequent processing
