    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the
            messages at the receiver side by further defining the type of
            transaction.

            Notes:
                - In application where transactions of various types are exchanged, the
                  Message Type Data Item facilitates the proper message handling at the
                  receiver side.

                element 1
                    raw
                remark
                    The STTN bit indicates when track numbering has been restarted. The STTN bit
                    is a toggle bit that changes its value whenever the SDPS system starts re-numbering
                    its tracks. Re-numbering of the track takes place either after SDPS start-up (cold or hot
                    start-up) or when a configuration set has been changed (please note that the latter
                    case is ARTAS specific behaviour and may be different in another SDPS).
