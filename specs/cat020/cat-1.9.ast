            Notes:

                1. It has to be stressed that a series of one or more W/E conditions
                   can be reported per target report.
                2. Data conveyed in this item are of secondary importance, and can
                   generally also be derived from the processing of mandatory items.
                3. Definitions can be found in SUR.ET1.ST03.1000-STD-01-01 Radar
                   Sensor Performance Analysis.
                4. The coding of Warning/Errors is kept consistent with category 048.

                2. Bit 16 (V) is normally set to zero, but can exceptionally be set to
                   one to indicate a non-validated Mode-3/A code (e.g. alert condition
                   detected, but new Mode-3/A code not successfully extracted).

        remark
            Notes:

                1. When Mode C code / Mode S altitude code is present but not
                   decodable, the “Undecodable Mode C code / Mode S altitude
                   code” Warning/Error should be sent in I020/030.
                2. When local tracking is applied and the received Mode S altitude
                   code corresponds to an abnormal value (i.e: the difference in
                   altitude between the current and the previous plot exceeds a
                   predefined system threshold), the “Mode C code / Mode S altitude
                   code abnormal value compared to the track“ Warning/Error should
                   be sent in I020/030.
                3. The value shall be within the range described by ICAO Annex 10
                4. For Mode S, bit 15 (G) is set to one when an error correction has
                   been attempted.

                2. For Mode S, D1 is also designated as Q, and is used to denote

                1. There is now a new Item for the Position Accuracy defined in
                   the Reserved Expansion Field (REF), more complete (includes a
                   Standard Deviation of Position in WGS-84) and is based on a
                   different calculation method (covariance instead of correlation).
                   It is recommended to use the new definition. Nevertheless, Item
                   I020/500 is kept in order to prevent a full incompatibility with
                   previous releases of ASTERIX Cat. 020 already implemented.
