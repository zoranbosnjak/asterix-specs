                element 8
                    raw

            Translation:
                See Annex 1 Centre ID definition
            Note:
                The Destination ID is irrelevant in CAT150 messages since the flight plan messages are sent to all 10 centres.
                Hence, the centre identifier is set to broadcast.
                The workstation identifier can be ignored.
