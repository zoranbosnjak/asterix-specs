    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the messages
            at the receiver side by further defining the type of transaction.

            Notes:

                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged,
                   the Message Type Data Item facilitates the proper message handling
                   at the receiver side.
                2. All Message Type values are reserved for common standard use.
                3. The list of items present for the four message types is defined in
                   the following table.
                   M stands for mandatory, O for optional, X for never present.

            The list of items present for the four message types is defined in the following

                1. Some sensors are not be able to scan the whole coverage in one
                   refresh period. Therefore, track extrapolation is performed in
                   un-scanned sectors. CST is then set to 01.
                2. Bit-8 (GHO) is used to signal that the track is suspected to have
                   been generated by a fake target.
