The following set of Report Types are standardised for Category 025 records:\n        • 001 Service and System Status report (see 4.5.1.1. above)\n        • 002 Component Status report (see 4.5.1.2. above)\n        • 003 Service Statistics report (see 4.5.1.3. above)\n    4.

Before changing the data source such\n       that the encoding of these Data Items is changed from “included” to\n       “not included” it needs to be ensured that downstream systems do not\n       apply “Mandatory Item Checks”. Otherwise this may lead to suppression\n       of the Category 025 Record by the receiving system.\n"

This\n       indication is independent from the status of the system itself or\n       that of the service. It just indicates that the system or service\n       volume output must not be used for operational services but may be\n       used for, e.g. test and validation purposes. The indication GO/NO-GO\n       indicates a mode of the system rather than a status. Usually this bit\n       will be set by operator input.\n    2. Bit 7/6 (OPS), when set to “1” indicates that the service is running\n       but not operationally used (e.g. for a standby system in a redundant configuration).\n    3. Bits 5/2 (SSTAT): This information informs about the state of the\n       overall service volume status. The actual implementation of this\n       field is service dependent and should be described in the system/service\n       specification. However, it is expected that – as far as this information\n       is available – a mapping is performed between the states of individual\n       components as reported in data item I025/120. As an example, if one\n       component fails but the system is still operational (at least partially),\n       the service status should change to “Degraded”.\n    4. To bit 7 (ERR): This bit set to “1” indicates that the range of the\n       target is beyond the maximum range in data item I048/040.In this\n       case – and this case only - the ERR Data Item in the Reserved\n       Expansion Field shall provide the range value of the Measured\n       Position in Polar Coordinates.\n    5. This octet allows to separate reporting of the system and the service\n       status as in particular in distributed systems it is possible that\n       the degraded system state may not have an impact on the service state.\n       For reasons of backwards compatibility (for systems that are not yet\n       capable to decode the first extension), the system and service status\n       shall be propagated to the field SSTAT in the primary part of I025/100,\n       bits 5/2 according to the following table: ::\n\n        SeSTAT  SySTAT  SSTAT\n\n        0       0       0\n        0       1       1\n        0       2       2\n        0       3       1\n        1       0       1\n        1       1       1\n        1       2       1\n        1       3       1\n        2       0       2\n        2       1       1\n        2       2       2\n        2       3       1\n        3       0       1\n        3       1       1\n        3       2       1\n        3       3       1\n\n       The value of 3 'Undefined' is assumed to represent that the status\n       cannot be determined. This inherently indicates a failure in system\n       monitoring. Therefore, a value of 3 'Undefined' is equivalent to 1\n       'Failed', leading to rejection of data and prompting maintenance/operator\n       investigation to occur.\n\n       The population of SSTAT is determined to be the worst-case combination\n       of SeSTAT and SySTAT, taking into account Note 1, where the hierarchy\n       of best to worst case is as follows: Running, Degraded, Failed.\n"

Error codes in the range 0 to 31 shall be allocated centrally by\n       the AMG. Error codes in the range from 32 to 255 are available for\n       specification by the system manufacturers.
