    000 "Report Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the reports at the
            receiver side by further defining the type of transaction.

            Notes:

                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged,
                   the Report Type Data Item facilitates the proper report handling at
                   the receiver side.
                2. All Report Type values are reserved for common standard use.
                3. The following set of Report Types are standardised for Category 025 records:
                    • 001 Service and System Status report (see 4.5.1.1. above)
                    • 002 Component Status report (see 4.5.1.2. above)
                    • 003 Service Statistics report (see 4.5.1.3. above)
                4. The list of items present for the three report types is defined in the
                   following table.
                   M stands for mandatory, O for optional, X for never present. ::

                    Item        001                 002             003

                    I025/140    X                   X               M

                    I025/600    O (See Note)        O               X

                5. With Edition 1.3 of this specification the Encoding Rules for Data
                   Item I025/600 and I025/610 in Message Type 001 have been changed
                   from “Mandatory” to “Optional”. Before changing the data source such
                   that the encoding of these Data Items is changed from “included” to
                   “not included” it needs to be ensured that downstream systems do not
                   apply “Mandatory Item Checks”. Otherwise this may lead to suppression
                   of the Category 025 Record by the receiving system.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. Bit 8 (NOGO), when set to “1” indicates that the data transmitted
                   by the system/service is not released for operational use. This
                   indication is independent from the status of the system itself or
                   that of the service. It just indicates that the system or service
                   volume output must not be used for operational services but may be
                   used for, e.g. test and validation purposes. The indication GO/NO-GO
                   indicates a mode of the system rather than a status. Usually this bit
                   will be set by operator input.
                2. Bit 7/6 (OPS), when set to “1” indicates that the service is running
                   but not operationally used (e.g. for a standby system in a redundant configuration).
                3. Bits 5/2 (SSTAT): This information informs about the state of the
                   overall service volume status. The actual implementation of this
                   field is service dependent and should be described in the system/service
                   specification. However, it is expected that – as far as this information
                   is available – a mapping is performed between the states of individual
                   components as reported in data item I025/120. As an example, if one
                   component fails but the system is still operational (at least partially),
                   the service status should change to “Degraded”.
                4. To bit 7 (ERR): This bit set to “1” indicates that the range of the
                   target is beyond the maximum range in data item I048/040.In this
                   case – and this case only - the ERR Data Item in the Reserved
                   Expansion Field shall provide the range value of the Measured
                   Position in Polar Coordinates.
                5. This octet allows to separate reporting of the system and the service
                   status as in particular in distributed systems it is possible that
                   the degraded system state may not have an impact on the service state.
                   For reasons of backwards compatibility (for systems that are not yet
                   capable to decode the first extension), the system and service status
                   shall be propagated to the field SSTAT in the primary part of I025/100,
                   bits 5/2 according to the following table: ::

                    SeSTAT  SySTAT  SSTAT

                    0       0       0
                    0       1       1
                    0       2       2
                    0       3       1
                    1       0       1

                    1       2       1
                    1       3       1
                    2       0       2
                    2       1       1
                    2       2       2
                    2       3       1
                    3       0       1
                    3       1       1
                    3       2       1
                    3       3       1

                   The value of 3 'Undefined' is assumed to represent that the status
                   cannot be determined. This inherently indicates a failure in system
                   monitoring. Therefore, a value of 3 'Undefined' is equivalent to 1
                   'Failed', leading to rejection of data and prompting maintenance/operator
                   investigation to occur.

                   The population of SSTAT is determined to be the worst-case combination
                   of SeSTAT and SySTAT, taking into account Note 1, where the hierarchy
                   of best to worst case is as follows: Running, Degraded, Failed.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. The Warning & Error codes contain information about the reason why
                   the System and Service State (SSTAT in item I025/100) is different
                   from “running”.
                2. A time source is considered as valid when either externally synchronised
                   or running on a local oscillator within the required accuracy of UTC.
                3. A value of 4 indicates that the allocation of Track-IDs was re-started.
                4. Multiple error codes can be transmitted within the same ASTERIX record.
                5. Error codes in the range 0 to 31 shall be allocated centrally by
                   the AMG. Error codes in the range from 32 to 255 are available for
                   specification by the system manufacturers. They are not standardised
                   and shall be described in the Interface Control Document (ICD) of the
                   respective system.

                - There is no special significance attributed to the numbering of the
                  TYPE field. However the range from 0 to 19 is intended to cover
                  generic messages which may be applicable to many types of service.

    200 "Message Identification"
        definition
            Identification of a unique message.
        element 24
            unsigned integer
        remark
            Notes:

                1. The Message Identification Number is to be used to uniquely identify
                   each message. If messages are being sent on redundant links then this
                   number shall be identical for the same message on each link. This will
                   allow the receiver to easily identify and discard duplicate messages.
                2. It is not required that Message Identification Numbers be assigned in
                   ascending order by time of message transmission.

        remark
            Notes:

                - Positive longitude indicates East. Positive latitude indicates North.
