            Notes:
                1. The current status should never be more restrictive than the default status.
                2. IC is usually set 1when the interrogator is a member of a cluster with a
                   decentralised data link responsibility protocol.
                   IC is usually set to 0 when the interrogator is connected to a GDLP. IC
                   settings shall comply with the rules defined in Ref.3.

                  For ROUTE and MSP packets the value of PR has no significance.  However,
                  for the purpose of standardisation, it is recommended that for ROUTE
                  packets, PR is set to 15 and for MSPs the PR should be set to 31.

            Notes:
                 1. A broadcast with a higher priority will temporarily delay a lower priority broadcast if
                    necessary. The delayed broadcast will be resumed as soon as possible for its
                    remaining time.

                  Address/Parity field (in this order), as defined in ICAO Annex 10. In the
