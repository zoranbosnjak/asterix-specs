    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the messages
            at the receiver side by further defining the type of transaction.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged,
                   the Message Type Data Item facilitates the proper message handling
                   at the receiver side.
                2. All Message Type values are reserved for common standard use.
                3. Message Types 33 to 37 have been designed for applications supporting
                   the ATCO in the optimisation of separation during final approach.
                   They provide information required to indicate to the ATCO the closest
                   possible distance of a following aircraft in relation to a leading
                   aircraft. This allows to make optimum use of the available runway capacity.
                4. The list of items present for the 31 types of messages is defined
                   in the following 4 tables.
                   M stands for mandatory, O for optional, X for never present. ::

    030 "Track Number 1"
        definition
            Identification of a track number related to conflict
        element 16
            raw
        remark
            Notes:

                1. This is the track number of the first track involved in the
                   conflict in case of an STCA or a RIMCA or the track involved
                   in case of one of the other Safety Net functions.
                2. This track number is distributed in this field exactly as it was
                   received from the Radar Processor Unit (identified by I004/015)
                   and its range is depending on the range used by that unit.
                3. In case of Message Type = 33 (Final Target Distance Indicator - FTD)
                   this represents the Track Number of the following aircraft.
                4. In case of Message Type = 34 (Initial Target Distance Indicator - ITD
                   this represents the Track Number of the following aircraft.
                5. In case of Message Type = 35 (Wake Vortex Indicator Infringement
                   Alert - IIA) this represents the track number of the following aircraft.
                6. In case of Message Type = 37 (Catch-Up Warning - CUW) this represents
                   the track number of the following aircraft (i.e. the one catching up).

    035 "Track Number 2"
        definition
            Together with I004/030, this item defines the track pair in conflict.
        element 16
            raw
        remark
            Notes:

                1. This is the track number of the second track involved in the
                   conflict in case of an STCA, a RIMCA, a NTCA, a VCD or in message

                2. For the other Safety Net functions, this item is not used.
                3. This track number is distributed in this field exactly as it was
                   received from the Radar Processor Unit and its range is depending
                   on the range used by that unit.
                4. In case of Message Type = 33 (Final Target Distance Indicator - FTD)
                   this represents the Track Number of the leading aircraft
                5. In case of Message Type = 34 (Initial Target Distance Indicator - ITD
                   this represents the Track Number of the leading aircraft.
                6. In case of Message Type = 35 (Wake Vortex Indicator Infringement
                   Alert - IIA) this represents the track number of the leading aircraft.
                7. In case of Message Type = 37 (Catch-Up Warning - CUW) this represents
                   the track number of the leading aircraft.
                8. In case of Message Type = 38 (Conflicting ATC Clearances - CATC)
                   this represents the track number of the aircraft to which the first
                   ATC Clearance was issued.

            Notes:

                1. This item only sent in “alive messages” to describe the status
                   of the Safety Net functions, handled by the system
                2. Value 0 means either that the function is not managed by the system
                   or has failed.
                3. Value 1 means that the function is managed by the system and is running well
                4. “Overflow” is defined as a situation where the number of alerts
                   in the system has exceeded the threshold for safe operation.
                   Potential prioritization of the alerts may lead to a loss of information.
                5. “Overload” is defined as a system status in which the number of
                   alerts does not allow for a reliable performance. A correct
                   calculation and transmission cannot be guaranteed.
                6. “System degraded” means that information from one or more sensors is lost.
