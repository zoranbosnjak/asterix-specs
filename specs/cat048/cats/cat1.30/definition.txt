        remark
            Notes:

                1. For Mode S aircraft, the SPI information is also contained in I048/230.
                2. To bits 3/2 (FOE/FRI): IFF interrogators supporting a three level
                   classification of the processing of the Mode 4 interrogation result
                   shall encode the detailed response information in data item M4E of
                   the Reserved Expansion Field of category 048. In this case the value
                   for FOE/FRI in I048/020 shall be set to “00”.
                   However, even those interrogators shall use I048/020 to encode the information “No reply”.
                3. To bit 6 (XPP): This bit shall always be set when the X-pulse has
                   been extracted, independent from the Mode it was extracted with.
                4. To bit 7 (ERR): This bit set to “1” indicates that the range of the
                   target is beyond the maximum range in data item I048/040.In this
                   case – and this case only - the ERR Data Item in the Reserved
                   Expansion Field shall provide the range value of the Measured
                   Position in Polar Coordinates.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. It has to be stressed that a series of one or more codes can
                   be reported per target report.
                2. Data conveyed in this item are of secondary importance, and
                   can generally also be derived from the processing of mandatory items.
                3. Definitions can be found in SUR.ET1.ST03.1000-STD-01-01 Radar
                   Sensor Performance Analysis.
                4. Values 25 to 30 have been defined to comply with the updated
                   European Mode S Specification (EMS) and to provide the possibility
                   to report the following information:

                       - Code 25: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
                         acquire the surveillance information has been reached;
                       - Code 26: the maximum number of permitted re-interrogations to
                         extract BDS Registers has been reached;
                       - Code 27: inconsistency detected between the contents of the
                         message and the BDS register overlayed;
                       - Code 28: a BDS swap has been detected and the respective information
                         has been discarded;
                       - Code 29: the track has been updated while being in the zenithal
                         gap (also referred to as “Cone of Silence”);
                       - Code 30: the radar had lost track of an aircraft and subsequently
                         re-acquired it.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. In case of no detection, the extrapolated position expressed in slant
                   polar co-ordinates may be sent, except for a track cancellation message.
                   No detection is signalled by the TYP field set to zero in I048/020
                   Target Report Descriptor.
                2. This item represents the measured target position of the plot, even
                   if associated with a track, for the present antenna scan. It is
                   expressed in polar co-ordinates in the local reference system,
                   centred on the radar station.
                3. In case of combined detection by a PSR and an SSR, then the SSR
                   position is sent.
                4. For targets having a range beyond the maximum range the data item
                   “Extended Range Report” has been added to the Reserved Expansion
                   Field of category 048. The presence of this data item is indicated
                   by the ERR bit set to one in data item I048/020, first extension.
                   The ERR data item shall only be sent if the value of RHO is equal
                   to or greater than 256NM.
                   Please note that if this data item is used, the Encoding Rule to
                   data item I048/040 still applies, meaning that the extra item in
                   the Reserved Expansion Field shall be transmitted in addition to
                   data item I048/040.
                   If the Extended Range Report item in the Reserved Expansion Field
                   is used, it is recommended to set the value of RHO in data item
                   I048/040 to its maximum, meaning bits 32/17 all set to 1.

                   is set to 0 for a calculated track. For Mode S, it is set to one
                   when an error correction has been attempted.
                2. For Mode S, bit 16 is normally set to zero, but can exceptionally
                   be set to one to indicate a non-validated Mode-3/A code (e.g. alert
                   condition detected, but new Mode-3/A code not successfully extracted).

                3. The total range covered is therefore from 0 to 11.21 °.
                4. Negative values are coded in two's complement form.
                5. Negative values are coded in two's complement form.
                6. The covered range difference is +/- 0.5 NM.
                7. Sending the maximum value means that the difference in range
                   is equal or greater than the maximum value.
                8. Negative values are coded in two's complement form.
                9. The covered azimuth difference is +/-360/2 7 = +/- 2.8125 °.
                10. Sending the maximum value means that the difference in range
                    is equal or greater than the maximum value.
