                        1. The flags M2, M3, MC refer to the contents of data items I048/050, I048/070
                           and I048/090 respectively. The flag M1 refers to the contents of data item

                           Subitem #5 (Extended Mode 1 Code in Octal Representation).

                           then the Military Emergency bit (ME) in Data Item I048/020, Target Report
                           Descriptor, shall be set.

                           Position bit set, then the Special Position Identification bit (SPI) in Data Item
                           I048/020, Target Report Descriptor, shall be set.

                        Under certain conditions PIN is available but NAT is not available. NAV then
                        indicates that the NAT field was not actively populated.

                    Notes:
                        Latitude in WGS 84 is expressed as a 24-bit two’s complement number.
                        Range -90° ≤ latitude ≤ 90°. Sign convention: North is positive.

                        Longitude in WGS 84 is expressed as a 24-bit two’s complement number.
                        Range -180° ≤ longitude < 180°. Sign convention: East is positive.
                        LSB = 180/223 degrees = 2.145767*10-05 degrees.

                        The resolution implied by the LSB is better than the resolution with which Mode 5
                        position reports are transmitted from aircraft transponders using currently defined
                        formats.

                    Notes:
                        1. If Subitem #1 is present, the M1 bit in Subitem #1 indicates whether the
                           Extended Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 5 reply or a Mode 1 reply. If Subitem
                           #1 is not present, the Extended Mode 1 Code is from a Mode 1 reply.
                        2. For reasons of backwards compatibility the logic for the setting of the V-bit
                           was inverted compared to other similar data items.
                        3. The values of the bits for V, G, L, A4, A2, A1, B2 and B1 shall be identical to
                           the values of the corresponding bits in data item I048/055.

                    Note:
                        Within Mode 5 replies/reports, the X-Pulse can be set for the following cases:
                        1. In a combined Mode 1 and Mode 2 reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the X2 bit
                           shall be set;
                        2. In a combined Mode 3 and Mode C reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the X3 bit
                           shall be set;
                        3. In a Mode 5 PIN data reply/report: in this case the X5 bit and the XP bit shall be set.
                        The X1 bit and the XC bit are meaningless as in Mode 1 and Mode C replies/reports
                        the X Pulse is not defined. They are kept for compatibility reasons.
        remark
            Note:
                In 2011 NATO has modified the format of the National Origin information
                available in subitem 2 of the Mode 5 data item in this Reserved Expansion Field. The
                information for National Origin and Mission Code were combined into a 11-bit long
                field. In order to maintain backwards compatibility and to ease the use of the new
                layout, the original Mode 5 data item was copied and the layout of subitem #2
                adapted. The new layout is reflected in the data item M5N and shall be used by
                equipment prepared for the new National Origin system.
                Equipment certified to the previous encoding shall continue to use the data item MD5
                corresponding to the 5-bit National Origin / 6-bit Mission Code.

        remark
            Notes:
                1. For radars with an operational range beyond 256 NM data item I048/040 is
                   insufficient. These radars may use this extension to provide the target position
                   equal to or beyond 256 NM. In such cases, data item I048/040 shall be
                   transmitted in addition to this extension. In this case it is recommended to
                   set bits 32/17 in data item I048/040 to “1”.
                2. The Encoding Rule for data item I048/040 still applies.
                3. This item represents the measured target position of the plot, even if
                   associated with a track, for the present antenna scan. It is expressed in polar
                   co-ordinates in the local reference system, centred on the radar station.
                4. In case of combined detection by a PSR and an SSR, then the SSR position is
                   sent.
                5. Before migrating an ASTERIX encoder to Edition 1.10 of this specification,
                   care has to be taken that receiving decoders allow the presence of the value
                   256 NM in the record. Systems applying a range check may otherwise
                   suppress the record.

                        2. If TCOUNTX is set to 0 then TCODEX is meaningless and all bits shall be set
