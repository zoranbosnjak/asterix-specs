        remark
            Note 1: The MoMu bit is used to indicate whether the target report
            was constructed from a multi-static (including bi-static) or
            mono-static sensor. Its setting dictates the interpretation of data
            items I015/625 and I015/626. The meaning of the value “other” shall
            be described in the system ICD.

            Note 2: In this context, a Reference Target Report stems from
            a non-aircraft target based on RF received externally to the system
            boundary. This may be generated, for example, by an external RF
            generator or a Permanent Echo or from a device, which is deployed
            in line of sight of the sensor.

            Note 3: A synthetic target is an internally generated diagnostic
            signal prior to the generation of the ASTERIX Category 015 target
            report. For example used to support test processes.

            Note 4: This value is used to represent externally generated
            targets or recorded data injected into the output data stream
            of the INCS system e.g. for test or training purposes.

            Note 5: This indication is used to inform about the scanning
            direction of the system (e.g. left/right, up/down,
            clockwise/anti-clockwise). It’s exact meaning is implementation
            dependent and shall be described in the system ICD.

    030 "Warning/Error Conditions"
        definition
            Warning/error conditions detected by a system for the target report
            involved.
        repetitive fx
            element 7
                raw
        remark
            Note 1: It has to be stressed that a series of one or more W/E
            conditions can be reported per target report.

            Note 2: The nature of the warning / error condition may differ
            between sensor types and the declaration and use of such alerts
            is driven by end user requirements.

            Note 3: Potential applications could be to indicate that the target
            report correlates with road infrastructure (terrestrial vehicles)
            or a wind turbine or that it is a fixed or slow moving return or
            originating from an area of high clutter. Such data items could
            also be used to indicate the presence of interference – either
            deliberate or accidental.

            Note 4: The Warning/Error Condition Values from 1-31 are reserved
            for designation by the ASTERIX Maintenance Group. System
            implementers are free to use values of 32 and above. The allocation
            of the remaining values of this data item shall be defined in a
            local Interface Control Document.

            Note 5: The value of “0” must not be assigned.

    050 "Update Period"
        definition
            Period until next expected output of a target report for this
            target.

                element 14
                    unsigned quantity 1/2^7 "s" <= 128
        remark
            Note 1: It is not necessary that all targets detected by the INCS
            sensor have target reports generated at the same update period.

            Note 2: This data item indicates the period until the next expected
            output of a target report for this target relative to the Time
            of Applicability contained in data item I015/145

    145 "Time of Applicability"
        definition
            Absolute time stamping for applicability of the measured
            information expressed as UTC.
        element 24
            unsigned quantity 1/2^7 "s" < 86400
        remark
            Note 1: The Time of Applicability refers to the information
            contained in data item I015/600, I015/601, I015/625, I015/626,
            I015/627, I015/628 whichever is available. In case of a Track End
            Message (Message Type = 5) it refers to the time at which the track
            is terminated and the track number (data item I015/161) is released
            for re-use.

            Note 2: A distributed sensor, such as an MSPSR, may have multiple
            elements that are each individually time stamped which are
            consolidated in to a target report. Rather than provide details
            of each time stamped message, this data item conveys the time
            of applicability of position of the target report.

            Note 3: The Time of Applicability value is reset to zero each day
            at midnight.

            Note 4: The Time of Applicability value shall be formatted as a
            binary unsigned integer.

    161 "Track/Plot Number"
        definition
            An integer value representing a unique reference to a track/plot
            record.
        element 16
            unsigned integer <= 65535
        remark
            Note 1: Track numbers are required for Sensor and Measurement
            Tracks. However, for Sensor and Measurement Plots the inclusion
            of a track number is optional – depending upon whether the INCS
            sensor has used tracking processing to reduce the false alarm
            rates.

            Note 2: The track number is allocated by the system.

            Note 3: The track number value shall be formatted as binary
            unsigned integers.

        remark
            Note 1: The indication for CSTP and/or CSTH applies only to data
            items I015/600 and I015/605 respectively. In case one of these data
            items is not present, CSTP and/or CSTH has no meaning.

            Note 2: A coasted track is one for which the sensor detections have
            been interrupted and whose position/height is being predicted based
            on the previously received responses.

            Note 3: The blind zone or blanked zone are predictable zones where
            no detection is predicted.
            If bit 5 is set and TTS = 1 then the track is coasted because it is
            in a blind zone or sector blank zone.

            Note 4: The indication TUR=1 shall be sent only with
            Message Type = 5 “Track End Message”.

                description
                    The orientation gives the direction, which the target nose
                    is pointing, relative to the Geographical North.
                element 16
                    unsigned quantity 360/2^16 "°" <= 360
                remark
                    Note: The orientation shall increment in a clockwise manner
                    relative to Geographic North.
        remark
            Note: If length and width cannot be clearly determined, the greater
            value of the two shall be transmitted as length.

    300 "Object Classification"
        definition
            Classification result of the object detection.

                    element 7
                        unsigned integer
        remark
            Note 1: INCS processing may be able to provide an indication of the
            nature of the target e.g. road vehicle or aircraft with the
            potential for further discrimination in the type of the aircraft
            e.g. two engine, fixed wing/helicopter etc.
            Before including requirements for target classification it is
            necessary to consider the operational manner in which such
            information would be used and how/if such data would be made
            available to the controllers.

            Note 2: Target classification is attributing, with an acceptable
            degree of confidence, a target report as having originated from
            a specific object or target type e.g. fixed wing aircraft, flock
            of birds etc. (It should be noted that the probabilities assigned
            to a target do not necessarily need to add up to 100%)
            The ability of an INCS sensor to classify the targets it detects
            is dependent upon the systems capabilities and is driven by end
            user requirements. The use of this optional data item is to be
            agreed between parties such as the system manufacturer, the system
            operator agency and the end user. The allocation of the CLS octet
            is to be defined in a local Interface Control Document that shall
            be agreed by both parties.

            Note 3: If this functionality is implemented in the sensor, the
            classification result (CLS), PRB and REP value shall be formatted
            as a binary unsigned integer.

    400 "Measurement Identifier"
        definition
            An identifier pointing to a measurement that was created from a
            specific contributing Tx/Rx Pair where the Pair Identifier refers
            to the index which details both the transmitter characteristics
            (DVB-T, DAB, FM, dedicated etc.) and the receiver characteristics.
            These are defined in ASTERIX Category 016 – Data Item I016/300).

        remark
            Note 1: INCS sensors may achieve their operational requirements
            based upon different techniques and technologies. Some may utilise
            multiple transmitter stations or multiple receiver stations.
            This data items provides the means for subsequent processing stages
            to be able to analyse the target report data based upon the system
            components that contributed to the formation of the target report.
            See ANNEX A for further details.

            Note 2: The Pair Identifier shall be defined in ASTERIX Category
            016 (Data Item I016/300).

            Note 3: The Observation Number is identifying an element of
            ‘raw data’ information. The sensor plots and sensor tracks are
            usually composed of several

                remark
                    Note: The velocity resolution describes the capability
                    of a sensor to be able to separate two closely located
                    targets in the velocity domain. The velocity resolution
                    for an INCS system depends on the signal integration time
                    as well as the transmit frequency. A longer integration
                    time or a higher transmit frequency leads to a better
                    velocity resolution. Depending on the specific INCS
                    application, a better velocity resolution may be more
                    important than a high sensor refresh rate. The velocity
                    resolution might also alleviate the limitations on the
                    range resolution, in order to make small bandwidth
                    applications possible.

        remark
            Note 1: Depending upon its design the manner in which the
            positional data is declared by an INCS sensor may be expressed
            in WGS-84 (I015/ 600) or sensor centric coordinate system based
            upon the ‘system reference point’ of the sensor (I015/625).

            Note 2: The optional ‘precision’ fields (in Data Items
            I015/600 – I015/625) provide a measure of the accuracy the INCS
            system has assigned to positional data contained in the target
            report.
            Such information can be used to improve the quality with which
            the INCS target report data is integrated in to the subsequent
            processing stages of the ATM infrastructure.
            However a consideration of the sensor characteristics and
            capabilities, the manner in which INCS data is used operationally,
            the weighting assigned to INCS data within a multi-sensor tracker
            and the credibility assigned to the covariance data items should
            be made to support the decision of whether these optional
            covariance data items are required or whether the basic data items
            provide sufficient performance.
            Whilst not an operational consideration the additional costs that
            may be associated with the provision and use of such data items
            should also be weighed against the potential performance benefits
            that would be achieved through the inclusion of these Data Items
            in performance specifications.

            Note 3: If I015/020 MoMu indicates that the target report is
            Bi-Static (MoMu =1) then the range information is the difference
            between the path from the transmitter to target to the receiver
            less the distance between the transmitter and receiver. In this
            case, the reference points referred to above are the positions
            of the transmitter and receiver.
            If I015/020 MoMu indicates that the target report is Mono-Static
            (MoMu =0) then the range information is the distance between
            the sensor and the target. In this case, the reference point
            referred to above is the position of the mono-static sensor.

            Note 4: The meaning of range in Category 015 is significantly
            broader than the traditional hence the different INCS working
            principles. This is especially true for bi-static and multi-static
            radars. For readability the field is still called range and not
            mono-/bi-/multi-static range or pseudo-range.
            For radar the measured range is calculated from time differences
            of signals assumed to be transmitted/received at the sensor
            reference point(s). As noted above for bi-static radars the
            reference points are the positions of the transmitter and receiver.
            Moreover multi-static radars may receive identical signals from
            other transmitters than the assumed reference transmitter
            (e.g. passive INCS which are using single frequency networks as
            illuminators) and therefore may calculate negative values for
            bi-static range measurement data.

            Before including the provision of such data items in the technical
            specification, it is advised that the cost and operational benefits
            of the availability of such data is assessed.
