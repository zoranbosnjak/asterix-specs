    000 "Report Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the
            reports at the receiver side by further defining the type of
            transaction.

            NOTES:
                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged, the
                   Report Type Data Item facilitates the proper report handling at the
                   receiver side.
                2. All Report Type values are reserved for common standard use.

        remark
            Notes:

                1. A time source is considered as valid when either externally
                   synchronised or running on a local oscillator within the
                   required accuracy of UTC.
                2. Bit 8 (NOGO), when set to “1” indicates that the data transmitted
                   by the GS is not released for operational use.
                3. Bit 2 indicates that the allocation of Track-IDs (Item I021/161)
                   was re-started.
