    000 "Report Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the
            reports at the receiver side by further defining the type of
            transaction.

            NOTES:
                1. In applications where transactions of various types are exchanged, the
                   Report Type Data Item facilitates the proper report handling at the
                   receiver side.

                1. A time source is considered as valid when either externally
                   synchronised or running on a local oscillator within the
                   required accuracy of UTC.
                2. Bit 8 (NOGO), when set to “1” indicates that the data transmitted
                   by the GS is not released for operational use.
                3. Bit 2 indicates that the allocation of Track-IDs (Item I021/161)
                   was re-started.
