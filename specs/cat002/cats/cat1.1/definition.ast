    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of the
            messages at the receiver side by further defining the type of
            transaction.
        element 8
            table
                1: North marker message
                2: Sector crossing message
                3: South marker message
                8: Activation of blind zone filtering
                9: Stop of blind zone filtering
        remark
            Notes:
                1. In application where transactions of various types are exchanged, the
                Message Type Data Item facilitates the proper message handling at the
                receiver side.

                2. Message Type values 1-127 are reserved for common standard use,
                whereas the values 128-255 are application dependent.

    010 "Data Source Identifier"
        definition
            Identification of the radar station from which the data are received.
        group
            SAC "System Area Code"
                element 8
                    raw
            SIC "System Identification Code"
                element 8
                    raw
        remark
            Notes:
                1. The defined SACs are listed in Part 1, Table 2 [Ref. 2]
                2. The defined SICs are listed in Part 1, Annex B [Ref. 2]

    020 "Sector Number"
        definition
            Eight most significant bits of the antenna azimuth defining a
            particular azimuth sector.
        element 8
            unsigned quantity 360/2^8 "°"
        remark
            The use of the antenna azimuth as sector number has the
            advantage of being independent of the number of sectors
            implemented.

    030 "Time of Day"
        definition
            Absolute time stamping expressed as UTC time.
        element 24
            unsigned quantity 1/2^7 "s"
        remark
            Notes:

                1. The time of day value is reset to zero each day at midnight.
                2. For time management in radar transmission applications, refer to Part 1,
                   paragraph 5.4 [ Ref.2].
                3. Data Item I002/030 can have various logical meanings. In a particular
                   message, the logical meaning is implicit from its context (e.g. in a North
                   marker message it represents the antenna North crossing time; in a
                   sector message it represents the antenna sector crossing time).

    041 "Antenna Rotation Speed"
        definition
            Antenna rotation period as measured between two
            consecutive North crossings or as averaged during a period
            of time.
        element 16
            unsigned quantity 1/2^7 "s"

        repetitive fx
            element 7
                raw
        remark
            Due to the diversity in hardware design and requirement of
            present and future radar stations, it is felt impractical to attempt to
            define the individual bits.

    060 "Station Processing Mode"
