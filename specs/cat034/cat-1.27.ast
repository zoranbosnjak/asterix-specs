    000 "Message Type"
        definition
            This Data Item allows for a more convenient handling of
            the messages at the receiver side by further defining
            the type of transaction.
        element 8
            table
                1: North marker message
                2: Sector crossing message
                3: Geographical filtering message
                4: Jamming strobe message
        remark
            Notes:

                1. In applications where transactions of various
                   types are exchanged, the Message Type Data Item facilitates the
                   proper message handling at the receiver side.
                2. All Message Type values are reserved for common standard use.
                3. The list of items present for the four message types is defined in
                   the following table.

                   M stands for mandatory, O for optional, X for never present.
